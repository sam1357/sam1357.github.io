          <h4>Running for CSESoc Secretary/Vice President (Internals)</h4>

        <p>
          I am a second year software engineering student. I was born in
          Auckland, New Zealand and thus a kiwiü•ù. I am one of the Media
          Directors for CSESoc this year, and was also a subcommittee member the
          year before. I have created many videos üìΩÔ∏è during this time, many of
          which you can find featuring me on the CSESoc Media YouTube channel :D
          <br /><br />
          In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, playing the cello,
          singing, watching YouTube and learning languages.
